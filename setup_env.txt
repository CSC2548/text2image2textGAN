Setting up environment

1. create a virtual environment, use python 3.6.
2. Output of pip freeze in the environment I used is given in requirements.txt, can be installed using pip3 -r requirements.txt, make sure you have already installed pip.
3. Create a folder with appropriate name, say root_folder, make it the working directory.
3. Run git clone https://github.com/CSC2548/text2image2textGAN 
, let's call this folder just created as 'the folder' or main_folder hereon.
Downloading datasets

Let's try to train the model on birds dataset.

4. Download cub_icml.tar.gz from https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0ywwgffWnLLLUc2WHYzM0Q2eWc/view into the folder.

5. Run curl -o CUB_200_2011.tgz http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia-data/CUB-200-2011/CUB_200_2011.tgz

6. Download cvpr2016_cub.tar.gz from https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0ywwgffWnLLZW9uVHNjb2JmNlE/view

7. Install skipthoughts using pip install skipthoughts.

8. Run git clone https://github.com/Cadene/skip-thoughts.torch.git

9. Extract all the compressed stuff downloaded.

10. In folder (create if not present) main_folder/data/skip-thoughts , download the following :
	a) curl -o dictionary.txt http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rkiros/models/dictionary.txt
	b) curl -o utable.npy http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rkiros/models/utable.npy
	c) curl -o uni_skip.npz http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rkiros/models/uni_skip.npz 

11. Copy cvpr2016_cub/text_c10 (this dataset was downloaded in #6), to main_folder/data, and rename this just copied text_c10 folder as 'birds_captions'.

12. From CUB_200_2011/CUB_200_2011 (this dataset was downloaded in #5), copy images.txt and bounding_boxes.txt, and paste these files in main_folder/data

13. Now open main_folder/config.yaml. The flowers dataset part doesn't concern us, we will be using birds one. Replace the birds part with following:
birds_images_path: 'path_to_main_folder/CUB_200_2011/CUB_200_2011/images'
birds_embedding_path: 'path_to_main_folder/cub_icml'
birds_text_path: 'path_to_main_folder/cvpr2016_cub/text_c10/'
birds_dataset_path: path_to_main_folder/birds.hdf5

val_split_path: 'path_to_main_folder/cub_icml/valclasses.txt'
train_split_path: 'path_to_main_folder/cub_icml/trainclasses.txt'
test_split_path: 'path_to_main_folder/cub_icml/testclasses.txt'

14. Now, open convert_birds_to_skipthought_hd5_script.py . Un-comment lines 100-102.

15. Now, run python3 convert_birds_to_skipthought_hd5_script.py . It should give a ~6gb birds.hdf5 file, in path specified in config.yaml.

16. Now, run python3 runtime.py --dataset birds
